      - speaker: Doug

      - speaker: Interviewer
        text: Can you describe your strengths and weaknesses?

      - speaker: Doug
        text: My greatest strength is adaptability. In a live performance, if the tech malfunctions or a line is dropped, the show must still go on.

      - speaker: Doug
        text: Thanks to this experience, I maintain a good performance even when I'm under pressure.

      - speaker: Doug
        text: But because I place such high value on presentation and 'getting it right,' my weakness is my tendency to over-edit myself.

      - speaker: Doug
        text: I'm working on it by establishing fair expectations for myself.

      - speaker: Doug
        text: (Okay Doug, aced the delivery!)
